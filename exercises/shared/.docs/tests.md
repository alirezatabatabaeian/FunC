<!-- TODO: write document

  This document should contain instructions on how to run the exercise's tests.

  The instructions should be short and to the point.

  The docs/TESTS.md file can contain a more verbose description on how to run tests.

  When a student downloads an exercise via the CLI, this file's contents are
  included into the HELP.md file.
